# Guess The Number
This is a simple single-page application built in the Electron environment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has two modes: classic and reversed.
In classic mode you need to guess the computer's number and in reversed mode you have to think about a number and give instructions to the computer that has to guess it.

# Guide
Download the package and run:
```
npm install
```

Then you can start the application locally by running:
```
npm run start
```

Alternatively, you can package it for Windows 32 bit using the electron-packager module by running
```
npm run package-windows
```

Finally, you can build a standalone Windows installer thanks to the electron-winstaller module using
```
npm run windows-installer
```
